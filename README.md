# IMBIRE 2.0
## Numeric methods project [JS]
### Mainly featutes
1.Analitical calculator for roots, extramas and derivatives 
2.Interpolation, Newton's and Lagrange's
3.Integration, Rectangles,trapezes and Simson's
4.Matrixes and system of equation

### 1.Analitical Calculator,
User gives expression like x^3-2x-1+1/x OR sin(cos(2-x)-x)+ln(x)-equation
Script converts expression to Reverse Polish Notation and again to expression to avoid error
Then it calculates roots by bisection, derivatives analitically and also extrama by finding
roots of derivative.
At the end script draw graph

### 2. Interpolation 
User gives few points
Script uses both algorithms, show how they works and gives final expression
At the end script draw graph

### 3.Integration
User gives expression like x^3-2x-1+1/x OR sin(cos(2-x)-x)+ln(x)-equation
Script converts expression to Reverse Polish Notation
Then use rectangle methods and show final number

### 4.Matrixes
User choose matrixes from 2x2,2x3 to 11x11,11x12
They are randomly fill with numbers
If matrix is square then 
	show determinant of matrix,
	transposed matrix, matrix of complements and inverse matrix
Else 
 show cramer method to solve matrix
 show LU method to solve matrix
